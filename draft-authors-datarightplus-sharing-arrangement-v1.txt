1.  Scope

   The scope of this specification is focused on describing the
   authorisation related components of establishing a CDR Sharing
   Arrangement.  This specification unavoidably references ecosystem
   specific concepts (Australian CDR) due to the very nature of
   localised claim names.  Sharing Arrangement V1 therefore is aligned
   with the definition of a CDR Arrangement as originally outlined
   within [CDS].

2.  Terms & Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Consumer", "Provider",
   "Initiator", "Personally Identifiable Information (PII)", "Pairwise
   Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)", "Initiator", "CDR Sharing
   Arrangement" and "CDR Sharing Arrangement Identifier" as defined by
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA].

3.  Provider

   The following provisions apply to services delivered by Providers.

3.1.  Authorisation Server

   In addition to the provisions outlined in
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE] the authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL NOT issue a refresh token unless the duration of the CDR
       Arrangement is greater than 0 (see [Request Object])
   2.  SHALL, where the supplied cdr_arrangement_id, if provided, does
       not match the authenticated Consumer and as soon as practicable,
       return an OAuth2 Error
   3.  SHALL modify the existing authorisation grant referenced by the
       cdr_arrangement_id, if provided, while maintaining the
       cdr_arrangement_id between such authorisations
   4.  SHALL revoke previously issued Access and refresh tokens when
       modifying existing authorisation grants;
   5.  SHALL support the Provider CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint
       (PCARE);
   6.  SHALL publish the url for the [Provider CDR Arrangement
       Revocation Endpoint (PCARE)] as an attribute named
       cdr_arrangement_revocation_endpoint within the OpenID Connect
       Discovery 1.0 [OIDC-Discovery] endpoint response;

3.1.1.  Request Object

   The request object submitted to the authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL support an optional integer parameter of sharing_duration
       representing the number of seconds requested for data sharing.
       The default value of this parameter SHALL be 0 and the maximum
       value SHALL NOT exceed 31536000.
   2.  SHALL support an optional string parameter cdr_arrangement_id
       referencing an existing CDR Arrangement (see CDR Sharing
       Arrangement Identifier);
   3.  SHALL reject requests containing a cdr_arrangement_id parameter
       that is unknown, expired or not associated with the requesting
       Initiator

3.1.2.  Claims

   The authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL include within the Introspection Endpoint response:
       1.  the exp claim, with a value equal to the expiry time of the
           underlying CDR Arrangement and;
       2.  the cdr_arrangement_id claim, containing the assigned [CDR
           Sharing Arrangement Identifier]
   2.  SHALL ensure the cdr_arrangement_id claim is persistent and does
       not change between token interactions;

3.2.  Provider CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint (PCARE)

   The Provider CDR Arrangement (PCARE) Revocation endpoint accepts a
   CDR Sharing Arrangement Identifier and immediately revokes the CDR
   Sharing Arrangement.

3.2.1.  PCARE Discovery

   The PCARE endpoint SHALL be advertised using the
   cdr_arrangement_revocation_endpoint attribute at the OpenID Connect
   Discovery 1.0 [OIDC-Discovery] endpoint.

3.2.2.  PCARE Request

   The PCARE endpoint receives requests using the HTTP POST [RFC7231]
   method with parameters sent as application/x-www-form-urlencoded data
   as defined in [W3C.REC-html5-20141028].

   In addition to authentication credentials described in Section 2.2 of
   [RFC7523] the endpoint includes the CDR Sharing Arrangement
   Identifier as an additional parameter, specified as follows:

   *  cdr_arrangement_id: REQUIRED The CDR Sharing Arrangement
      Identifier previously provided in the token and introspection
      endpoint responses.

   An example request to the Provider CDR Arrangement Revocation
   Endpoint is as follows:

POST https://data.provider.com.au/arrangements/revoke
HTTP/1.1
Host: data.Provider.com.au
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&
client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEyNDU2In0.ey ...&
cdr_arrangement_id=5a1bf696-ee03-408b-b315-97955415d1f0

   On receipt of a valid request the Provider authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL validate the client credentials as per Section 2.2 of
       [RFC7523] and;
   2.  SHALL validate the cdr_arrangement_id relates to a valid CDR
       Sharing Arrangement and;
   3.  SHALL verify the CDR Sharing Arrangement referenced by specified
       cdr_arrangement_id belongs to validated client
   4.  If all of the above conditions are met the authorisation server:
       *  SHALL immediately invalidate the CDR Arrangement
       *  SHALL immediately invalidate all refresh tokens associated
          with the CDR Arrangement
       *  SHALL immediately invalid all access tokens associated with
          the CDR Arrangement

3.2.3.  PCARE Response

3.2.3.1.  Successful Response

   In the event of a successful revocation, the authorisation server:

   1.  If the CDR Sharing Arrangement is revoked, SHALL respond with a
       204 HTTP status code containing no content
   2.  If the CDR Sharing Arrangement was already revoked prior to the
       request being received, SHOULD respond with a 204 HTTP status
       code containing no content

3.2.3.2.  Failure Response

   In the event of a failure to validate the CDR Arrangement conditions
   the authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL respond with a 422 Unprocessable Entity response containing
       a JSON payload structured as as described below and;
   2.  SHOULD respond with a 503 Service Unavailable if currently
       unavailable and MAY supply a Retry-After indicating the earliest
       retry time

3.2.3.2.1.  Failure Response Body

   The failure response body is an object with a single attribute of
   errors containing an array of one object with the following fields:

   *  code with the value of urn:au-cds:error:cds-all:Authorisation/
      InvalidArrangement
   *  title with the value of The arrangement could not be found.
   *  detail with a value containing the provided cdr_arrangement_id

   A non-normative example of the payload is provided below:

{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": "urn:au-cds:error:cds-all:Authorisation/InvalidArrangement",
            "title": "The arrangement could not be found.",
            "detail": "b3f0c9d0-457d-4578-b0cd-52e443ae13c5"
        }
    ]
}

4.  Initiator

   The following provisions apply to participants operating individual
   Initiators.

4.1.  Authorisation Client

   An Initiators authorisation client:

   1.  SHALL support the provisions specified in Section 4 of
       [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE]
   2.  SHALL support the submission of Request Object parameters
       outlined in [Request Object]
   3.  SHALL call the [Provider CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint
       (PCARE)] following;
       1.  revocation request is requested by the Consumer using the
           Initiator Consumer Dashboard or;
       2.  where a refresh token has not been issued, as soon as
           practicable following the completion of data collection
   4.  SHALL support the [Initiator CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint
       (ICARE)]
   5.  SHALL retry requests to the [Provider CDR Arrangement Revocation
       Endpoint (PCARE)] where the response received was a HTTP Status
       503.  The retry time SHOULD be informed by the presence of the
       Retry-After header.

4.2.  Initiator CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint (ICARE)

   The Initiator CDR Arrangement (ICARE) Revocation endpoint accepts a
   CDR Sharing Arrangement Identifier and immediately revokes the CDR
   Sharing Arrangement.

4.2.1.  ICARE Request

   The protected resource calls the ICARE endpoint using an HTTP POST
   [RFC7231] request with parameters sent as application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded data as defined in [W3C.REC-html5-20141028].

   cdr_arrangement_jwt REQUIRED.  A single signed [JWT] containing the
   following parameters:

   1.  cdr_arrangement_id representing the CDR Sharing Arrangement
       Identifier previously provided in the introspection endpoint
       responses;
   2.  iss: Provider ID issued by the Ecosystem Authority
   3.  sub: Provider ID issued by the Ecosystem Authority
   4.  aud: URI to the ICARE endpoint
   5.  jti: A unique identifier for the token
   6.  exp: Expiration time on or after the JWT must not be accepted

   In addition, the client includes an Authorization header parameter
   with a Bearer token containing a single signed [JWT] with the
   following parameters:

   1.  iss: Provider ID issued by the Ecosystem Authority
   2.  sub: Provider ID issued by the Ecosystem Authority
   3.  aud: URI to the ICARE endpoint
   4.  jti: A unique identifier for the token
   5.  exp: Expiration time on or after the JWT must not be accepted

   For example, a Provider may request CDR Arrangement revocation with
   the following request:

POST https://data.Initiator.com.au/arrangements/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: data.Initiator.com.au
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEyNDU2In0.ey …

cdr_arrangement_jwt=eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEyNDU2In0.ey ...&

   The Initiator first validates the Provider credentials and then
   verifies whether the CDR Sharing Arrangement Identifier exists and
   was issued by the Provider making the CDR Arrangement Revocation
   request.  If this validation fails, the request is refused and the
   Provider is informed of the error by the ICARE endpoint as described
   below.

   In the next step, the Initiator invalidates the CDR Arrangement and
   SHOULD discard associated tokens.  Data Minimisation events SHOULD
   also be triggered on receipt of this event.

4.2.2.  ICARE Response

4.2.2.1.  Successful Response

   In the event of a successful revocation, the Initiator:

   1.  if the CDR Sharing Arrangement is revoked, SHALL respond with a
       204 HTTP status code containing no content
   2.  if the CDR Sharing Arrangement was already revoked prior to the
       request being received, SHOULD respond with a 204 HTTP status
       code containing no content

4.2.2.2.  Failure Response

   In the event of a failure to validate the CDR Arrangement conditions
   the Initiator:

   1.  SHALL respond with a 422 Unprocessable Entity response containing
       a JSON payload structured as as described below and;
   2.  SHOULD respond with a 503 Service Unavailable if currently
       unavailable and MAY supply a Retry-After indicating the earliest
       retry time

4.2.2.2.1.  Failure Response Body

   The failure response body is an object with a single attribute of
   errors containing an array of one object with the following fields:

   *  code with the value of urn:au-cds:error:cds-all:Authorisation/
      InvalidArrangement
   *  title with the value of The arrangement could not be found.
   *  detail with a value containing the provided cdr_arrangement_id

   A non-normative example of the payload is provided below:

{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": "urn:au-cds:error:cds-all:Authorisation/InvalidArrangement",
            "title": "The arrangement could not be found.",
            "detail": "b3f0c9d0-457d-4578-b0cd-52e443ae13c5"
        }
    ]
}

5.  Implementation Considerations

   Where a Initiator, by way of the [Request Object], requests to update
   an existing authorisation grant through the supply of the
   cdr_arrangement_id some ecosystems may apply additional expectations
   with respect to the authorisation flow.  Within the Australian
   Consumer Data Right this is summarised within the _CX Standards:
   Amending Authorisation_ section of the [CDS].

6.  Security Considerations

   The CDR Sharing Arrangement Identifier SHALL NOT be guessable,
   derivable nor identify the Consumer.
